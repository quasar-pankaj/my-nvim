# My Config for neovim

Being a C++ and Flutter developer I am trying to configure Neovim accordingly. This is still incomplete because it is throwing up errors when trying to format code.

## How to use

``` Bash
git clone https://github.com/quasar-pankaj/my-nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim && nvim
```
